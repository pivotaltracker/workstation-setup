# Tracker Workstation Setup

This project automates the process of setting up a new Pivotal machine using a simple [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script.

# PLEASE SEE [THE CONTRIBUTING_TRACKER.md DOC](CONTRIBUTING_TRACKER.md) BEFORE SUGGESTING CHANGES OR MODIFYING THIS REPO

## Core Principles


* Prefer the defaults (or more sameness) to eliminate controversy and conflict 
  * Always prefer the default keymaps/shortcuts/settings
* If default keymaps conflict, the ones defined in the primary developer tools (Jetbrains IDEs) and/or designer tools (Sketch/Photoshop/etc) should win and not be overridden by other apps
* Base tracker workstation setup has minimal changes on top of standard workstation-setup, only stuff that is truly necessary and/or useful across all pods.
* Customizations on the main workstations should be disjoint, i.e. don't write code that automatically reverts a config or setting from the base setup; instead open a discussion about changing or removing the default.
* Not everything is refreshed/updated daily.  The philosophy of the upstream `workstation-setup` repo is specifically that
  it is **NOT** intended to be re-run on existing workstations.
* Not everything has to be automated, it's OK to just put manual steps for something in this README_TRACKER.md file, but
  if it's critical to be done, make sure you record it somehow!  
* Keep it simple, stupid!

## Important Guidelines

* We manage all Jetbrains IDEs via Jetbrains Toolbox.  Do not install them manually or via brew/cask.

## Getting Started
**We recommend you use the pre-created workstation-setup image on DeployStudio. To do so, please follow the steps in
[Image a Workstation](https://docs.trackernonprod.com/#general/image-a-workstation/).**

## Mojave Notes

Mojave isn't officially supported yet, but here are some gotchas for it:

### Mysql2 Gem Install on Mojave

* Review [this stackoverflow comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30834421/error-when-trying-to-install-app-with-mysql2-gem/39628463#39628463).
* However, ***NOTE*** of those suggestions seems to work except [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30834421/error-when-trying-to-install-app-with-mysql2-gem/39628463#comment67227723_39628463):
  * `export MYSQL_GEM_VERSION=0.4.10` ...or whatever is in the Gemfile 
  * `gem install mysql2 -v ${MYSQL_GEM_VERSION} -- --with-ldflags=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib --with-cppflags=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include`
* That means you'll have to wait for the `setup.sh` run to fail, go to the tracker-web folder, run that
  manually to get mysql2 native gem installed for tracker, then re-run `setup.sh`

### Manually running workstation-setup
If you are developing workstation-setup or want to add customizations to it for your own laptop you will need to run
workstation-setup manually.

1. Follow steps 1-8 in
   [Image a Workstation](https://docs.trackernonprod.com/#general/image-a-workstation/).
   However, on step 5, choose *Individual Workstation High Sierra*.
1. Open up `Terminal.app` and run the following command:

    ```sh
    curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivotaltracker/workstation-setup/master/bootstrap.rb -o /tmp/bootstrap.rb && chmod +x /tmp/bootstrap.rb && /tmp/bootstrap.rb && cd ~/workspace/workstation-setup && ./setup.sh
    ```
1. Follow the instructions in [Post-Install Steps Before Cutting an image](#post-install-steps-before-cutting-an-image)
   and [Post-Imaging Steps](#post-imaging-steps).

1. If the setup fails with an error around NVM or Node, install Node 10 and try the script again
    ```sh
    nvm install 10
    ```
## Post-Install Steps Before Cutting an image
Run these steps only if you are in the process of cutting a fresh DeployStudio image

## Workstation Setup Repo
Change the remote to be writable
```bash
cd ~/workspace/workstation-setup
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:pivotaltracker/workstation-setup.git
```
